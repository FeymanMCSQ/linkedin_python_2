Picture this: It’s 2035. You’re walking through a bustling smart city. Your phone hasn’t been plugged in for weeks. The sensor-laden bridge you cross monitors its own structural health—powered solely by vibrations from passing cars. Even your jacket charges your devices as you move. No wires. No batteries. Just 𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘨𝘺 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦.  
This isn’t magic. It’s 𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗴𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴—and it’s already here.

Elena, a sustainability engineer, once forgot to charge her smartwatch. Frustrated, she redesigned it. Her prototype used 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗴𝘆 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮𝗿𝗺 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 and 𝗯𝗼𝗱𝘆 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘁 to self-charge. One morning, after a jog, she glanced at her watch: 100% 𝘣𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘺. “I’ll never hunt for a charger again,” she laughed.  
Two years later, her startup’s tech powers emergency sensors in disaster zones—no batteries needed.
