Let me tell you about Emma.  
Five years ago, she spent her days manually logging inventory data at a warehouse—until automation took over. Panic set in: “𝘞𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘐 𝘣𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘰𝘣𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘦𝘵𝘦?” Fast-forward to today: Emma now trains AI systems to analyze supply chain patterns and mentors teams on leveraging these tools. Her job didn’t vanish—it 𝗲𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝗱.  

This is the future of work. Not a sci-fi dystopia, but a partnership where automation handles repetition, and humans focus on what we do best: 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘦, 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘤𝘵, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘢𝘥𝘢𝘱𝘵.
