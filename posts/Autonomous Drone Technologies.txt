Imagine this: It’s 4:30 AM, and Maria, a farmer in rural Kenya, wakes up to check her crops. Instead of wandering her 50-acre field under a dim morning sky, she sips her coffee while a fleet of autonomous drones hum softly overhead. Equipped with multispectral cameras, they scan for pests, hydration levels, and nutrient gaps—sending real-time insights to her phone. By sunrise, Maria already knows 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘭𝘺 where to focus her day.  

This isn’t science fiction. It’s happening now.
